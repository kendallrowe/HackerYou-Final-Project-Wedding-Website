# HackerYou Intro to Web Dev/Advanced Web Dev Final Project

This single-page site was built as part of the continuing education Intro to Web Development/Advanced Web Development programs at HackerYou. 

In preparation for my wedding in December 2019, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to create a wedding website and showcase my love for my fianc√©e Victoria Zefkic. 

This project was completed May, 2019.

## Requirements
For this final project required students to come up with a dynamic, single-page, fully responsive website structured around any topic of their choosing.
